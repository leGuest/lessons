HTML is a way to format text.
But what if we want to add colors and others fancy stuff?


#### The old and the deprecate way

  + The very _old, deprecated way_, is to add a __property__ to a tag 
    that will add the so-call tag some fancyness.

    ```
      <font color="red">My text in red</font>
    ```

    would result as:

    <p style:"color:red">My text in red</p>

    But it won't. The current version of HTML (HTML5) does not support this
    feature. Instead, you will see:

    <p style:"color:red">My text in red</p>

    Nobody uses that anymore, it just for your information and/or the very rare case
    you meet it.
