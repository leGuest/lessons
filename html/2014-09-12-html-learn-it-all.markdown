####[How much tags do I have to know to make an UI?](#how-much-tags)

These lessons won't cover all the tags of html.

Here is the specification of html: [w3c/html][1], a reference for html. It's ~26 hours of reading,
You might not want to do that.

When you want to do something, ask the biggest information base : internet.
So search for : how to do \<x\> in HTML5, see if it works. Then see what [w3c][1] says, so you can have precise
details on a tag or a set of tags.

####[Others  ressources](#others-ressources)

Other ressources are :

  + [stackeroverflow][2] : is a community where devs asks for a precise issue, and others give answers.

  + [github.com][3] : is a service to host open source project. You can stalk into projects to see some implementations.
