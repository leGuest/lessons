To make an html document, simply make a file with the extension ``.html``
That will tell the browser that the file should be interpreted as html.

However, we need to give him additional information:

  + The _version_ of html we're using : It's currently HTML5.
    This will be important for the future

  + The _title_ of the document : So it can be displayed in the browser window:

  ![window browser title](../assets/images/html__metatag--browsertitle.jpg)

  + A favicon which is an icon (a little image) that be displayed in the browser window:
  ![favicon](../assets/images/html__metatag--favicon.jpg)
