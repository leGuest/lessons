good practises part 1
----

#### What is a good practise?

A good practise is a rule that is commonly accepted by the community of a language.
This concept of good practise also apply in HTML.

In the [previous lesson](./2014-09-10-html-tag-exception.markdown) :


> So when a tag have no content inside, it's better to use this shortcut :

> ``<tag name/>``

> instead of:

> ``<tag name></tagname>``.

Using __autoclose tag__ is a good practise.

#### Why doing good practise?

It's often for readability.
Developers use __different way of coding to obtain the same result__.

The code of a developer might not be clear for another developer.
As so, there is conventions, and style guides grouped in good practise, so every
developer with understand code in the same way.

Sometimes, it's a matter of performance.

So if you don't use good practises, your code might work.
Yet it has big chances that other developers won't understand what you coded.
It have also chances that you won't understand the code you wrote 3 months before
because you don't remember what the code were doing.
